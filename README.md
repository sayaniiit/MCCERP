Measuring Code Comprehension Effort Using Code Reading Pattern

In the software industry, 85% of development tasks involve maintenance. A developer's typical job involves more of code reading and less of code writing. Since code reading is an integral part of comprehension, efficient code reading emphasizes a better understanding of the given code's execution. The more efficiently a code is read, the more it reduces the code maintenance time. Thus, the developer's reading pattern can help to estimate how efficiently a developer can read and comprehend code that can improve software productivity. Quantifying the comprehension effort spent while reading a code can help to explore the developer's efficiency. The primary objective of this study is to quantify the comprehension effort using code reading patterns. An eye-tracking sensor is used to track the developer's eye movements while reading the code. The trace backs and internal navigation are identified from the reading pattern of the code and used to compute program comprehension effort. An experiment is conducted to collect the data where 41 students were asked to read five short C programs. The findings of the study infer a significant correlation between comprehension effort and fixation points. From the collected data, the study explores that non-experts involve in higher comprehension effort than the expert ones.
